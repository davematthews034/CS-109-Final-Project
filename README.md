Notes:
In our submission, we are including CS109 Final Project.ipynb. This handles all of our code for the project.

Our analysis includes a block of code which involves repeated calls to the Rotten Tomatoes API. Due to rate limits, the block of code may only be run *once* per day. Our file thus contains a movieframe.csv that contains all the relevent information from the API.

We also have an image file, for fun.
